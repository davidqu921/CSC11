This course introduces the basic conceptual elements of machine learning. We will cover the mathematical foundations for methods in regression, classification and unsupervised learning. These include linear and nonlinear basis-function regression, Gaussian Process regression, class-conditional models, decision trees, logistic regression, k-means, mixture models, principal component analysis, artificial neural networks. The main course web site will maintain a calendar to specify when specific topics will be covered, the assignments dates and provide handouts.
